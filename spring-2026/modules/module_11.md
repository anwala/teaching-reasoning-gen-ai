# Ethical concerns of Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) especially Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is arguably one of the most consequential technologies of the 21st century. The ability to automate cognition opens a door of many opportunities such as, the advancement of [protein folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold) and drug discovery research (essential in curing diseases), accurate object detection and image classification (crucial in robotics), language generation (used in summarization, code generation, question answering), etc. 

However, AI also raises serious ethical questions such as, the prospect of [job displacement](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/podcasts/the-daily/amazon-robots-job-automation.html), unfair or biased outcomes of AI in [criminal justice](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-daily/wrongfully-accused-by-an-rPoU0HXfNME/) or in [warfare](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7jrez2jno), or use of AI to generate [deepfakes](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/magazine-features/top-10-deepfakes), or its adverse [environmental impact](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8efHyRAbC7Q).

Here will explore these ethical issues and attempt to find creative solutions for some of them.

## Concepts
* [Ethical framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20240513055008/https://honors.umaine.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2020/10/A-Framework-for-Thinking-Ethically.pdf)

# People as data generators

## Introduction

Whether making a call on a cell phone or searching for a recipe on a search engine, or swiping a credit card to make a purchase, the technologies that we have come to love and cannot live without collect massive amounts of data about our lives. This data is controlled by large corporations that can build sophisticated software to predict our behaviors and target us with ads.

Here, we will explore how our interaction with technology generates data and investigate what can be inferred from our data.

## In-class individual task

* Create your detailed timestamped digital footprint for a normal day. E.g.,

| **Item** | **Time** | **Activity**       | **Digital trace**                                                     |
|----------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.       | 6 am     | Check weather      | Location data                                                         |
| 2.       | 6 am     | Check smart watch  | Location, Heart rate, sleep information, physical activity level, etc.|
| 3.       | 6:30 am  | Check school email | All student/faculty interactions                                      |
| ...      | ...      | ...                | ...                                                                   |

## In-class group task

* Study the digital footprints of your group members. What can you infer from them? Can you identify individuals with similarities across different dimensions such as interests, personalities, etc.?
* Explain in detail your method for identifying such similarities, would your approach work if you had 1 million digital footprints?

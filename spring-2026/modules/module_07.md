# "Hello, World!" and Programming with LLMs

## Introduction

Whatever your career aspiration, programming is a useful fun way to increase your productivity. It used to be something just for the computer nerds/scientists but things have changed; especially since the release of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT which can generate code. Journalists, business analysts, researchers, etc., can now boost their productivity and convert ideas into software prototypes with programming aided of GenAI.

Here, we will learn how to develop applications in Python using Generative AI technologies guided by the our Problem Solving Philosophy (PSP):
* Decomposing non-trivial problems into actionable and testable subproblems
* Developing algorithms to solve subproblems
* Implementing and evaluating Python-based solutions and iterating.

## ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

Design separate prompts for each of the following tasks:
1. To learn about the `"Hello, World!"` program.
2. Write the `"Hello, World!"` program in Python.
3. Modify code generated in 2. to say `"Hello, <Your name here>!"` e.g., `"Hello, Alex!"`
4. Modify code generated in 3. to ask for a user's name, and then to respond with `"Hello, <User-name provided as input here>!"`

## Summary statistics program
**Goal:** Develop re-usable code for calculating the `average` (and next, `minimum` and next `maximum`) of a list of user-input numbers.

Apply PSP to solve this problem:
1. What are the subproblem?
2. Design prompts to solve each subproblem.
3. Solve whole problem by stitching solutions of subproblems
4. Evaluate and iterate.

Let's reflect.

### Tips:
* Be curious and adventurous. Ask question and test things out and learn why/how the code workscode)
* Run code
* Errors are expected
* Try understanding any GenAI-produced code.
* Patience, 
* Evaluate
* Keep It Simple (KIS!)

## Your Program (In-class group task)

Identify a specific problem in a domain you care about (e.g., Health, Education, Entertainment, Business). Apply PSP to design prompts to solve the problem.

Present your findings (starting with problem domain, problem, and LLM) and answer the following questions:
1. Are you satisfied with the solution? Why?
2. What are the subproblem?
3. How did you arrive at your final prompt (show the evolution of your prompt)
4. How did you evaluate the response of the LLM
5. Provide additional feedback
6. Goto Wild Card Program

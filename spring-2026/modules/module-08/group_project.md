# Reasoning with Generative AI (DATA 101-02) Group Project Description (20 points)

**Due:** May XX, 2026, 2pm

#### Introduction

The goals of this group project includes fostering and assessing your real-world problem-solving skills, collaboration, time management, and communication skills. These skills are essential for success.

#### Group formation and task division

You will work in small groups (likely, 2 people) on a final project consisting of:

* identifying a data source
* asking 1-2 relevant and meaningful research questions about the data

Negotiate with me to finalize your decision of for both points by March 20, 2026. The earlier the better.

* produce a short report (2-3 pages) OR in-class presentation explaining the data, your analysis and results, potential shortfalls or uncertainties, and how AI was used to aid in your work
* a summary of specific contributions made to the project by each member of the group

With regard to the last point, it is not guaranteed that each member of a group will receive the same grade. If you feel that a group member is not pulling their weight you should:

* attempt to address the issue with the group member in a polite and professional manner
* if this is not successful, bring the matter to my attention. If need be, I may adjust the group structure or work with you to adjust the expectations accordingly.

Additional details and specifications will be discussed in class and posted. Your final report will be due May, XX, 2025.

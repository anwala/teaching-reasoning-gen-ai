# W&M DATA 101-02 - Reasoning with Generative AI, Spring 2026 Syllabus

[Jump to Summary Schedule](#summary-schedule) | [Self](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-network-analysis/blob/main/spring-2024/syllabus.md)

## Course Overview

Every minute each day, [about 16,000 TikToks are uploaded, 3.4 million videos watched on YouTube, 5.9 million Google searches, 1.8 million ChatGPT prompts, and 18.8 million sent text messages](https://www.domo.com/learn/infographic/data-never-sleeps-12). We generate tons of data which can be mined to gain valuable information about our health, and economic or social condition. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of data, including, how data it can be represented and visualized, and how to process it to derive meaningful results with computer programs designed with and without generative AI (specifically, large language models, or LLMs).

Throughout the course an emphasis will be placed on important problem-solving pillars including, problem decomposition, abstraction, modular, logically planned problem solving approaches, and critical evaluation of code and results, whether AI or human-generated. Moreover students would learn and be encouraged to effectively communicate both intentions and results visually and in writing. No prior programming experience is required. This course is suitable for individuals from any major who want to develop modern computing skills applicable across a variety of disciplines.

Upon successfully completing the course, students will be well equipped to with fundamental knowledge needed to begin more in-depth studies and problem-solving of Data Science problems.

## Course Objectives

After completing this course, you should be able to do the following:

* Decompose non-trivial problems into actionable and testable subproblems
* Develop algorithms to solve subproblems with the aid of Generative AI tools
* Implement and evaluate python-based solutions with the aid of Generative AI tools.

## Grading

There will be a total of **100 points** (60 points for assignments, 20 points for final exam (no midterms), and 20 points for participation).

### Assignment Types

I will post all assignments on our [DATA 101-02 course website](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-reasoning-gen-ai/blob/main/fall-2026/README.md). Your grade in this class will be based on the following components:

**Homework (HW)** - **60** points

* 4 homework assignments (HW1 -- HW4), each worth 15 points
* All work must be your own. You may use resources on the Internet for reference as long as you cite your sources (including URL). Group work on HW assignments is not acceptable.

**Participation/Attendance** - **20** points

Participation is very important and contributes additional dimensions to discussions. You are expected to complete all assigned readings before class and be ready to discuss with your peers, and apply your knowledge during class learning activities. 

Throughout the semester you will have the opportunity to accumulate a maximum of **20** participation points (2 points maximum per week) for the following in-class activities: 
1. Participating in in-class individual task
2. Participating in in-class group task

**No Midterm exam**

**Final exam (Group project with individual component)**- **20** points

## Course Policies

### Piazza

Each student must check the class [Piazza (DATA 101-02)](https://piazza.com/class/mhnwdp86nr910/) daily. You should use our class Piazza forum to ask and answer general course-related questions. I will use Piazza to notify you about important updates (assignment deadline changes, office hours cancellations, etc.).

### Participation

Regularly stay involved in class activities. This includes checking Piazza for announcements, submitting assignments on time, and responding to discussion posts in a timely manner.

### Seeking Help

The course Piazza forum should be your first reference for questions about the class. If you have questions about the course requirements or materials, post your questions on Piazza. For extra help, attend [office hours](https://alexandernwala.com/contact/).

### [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/)

W&M's Student Accessibility Services offer a variety of services (e.g., [Watson Lab](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/watsonlab/index.php) and [special needs housing](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/specialhousing/index.php)) for William & Mary students.

The mission of Student Accessibility Services is to create a barrier-free environment for matriculating students with debilitating diagnosed conditions by considering reasonable accommodations upon request on an individual and flexible basis. 

Student Accessibility Services strives to foster student independence, to encourage self-determination, to emphasize empowerment and accommodation over limitation, and to create a comprehensive, accessible environment to ensure that individuals are viewed on the basis of contribution, not deficit.

## W&M's [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/index.php)

Among the most significant traditions of William & Mary is its student-administered honor system. The essence of the honor system is individual responsibility. We entrust students to maintain the Code and adjudicate matters involving alleged violations of the Code.

The Honor Code is an enduring tradition at the University with documented history that originates as far back as 1736. Today, students administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the University. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs.

The Honor Code prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. For definitions of each offense, view [Section VI: Infractions](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/section_VI/index.php) of the Honor Code.
* **Lying:** the presentation of false information with the intent to deceive.
* **Cheating:** including, but not limited to, the following acts: 
  * Plagiarism
  * Unauthorized Assistance/Collaboration
  * Use of Unauthorized Materials
  * Unauthorized Dual Submission of Previous Academic Work
  * Time Constraint Violation
  * Directions Violation
* **Stealing:** knowingly taking or appropriating the property of another, including property of the university, without the rightful owner’s permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently or substantially. One does not receive rightful permission if it is induced by fraud or deception.
